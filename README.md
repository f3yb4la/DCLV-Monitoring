# DCLV-Monitoring

Because AE is shutting down their web portal Sitelink at the end of March 2020 i was searching about a way how i can monitor my AE/Refusol DCLV PC heater in the future.

Therefor i startet this repo to share my project with all of you who are in the same situation and searchng for an solution.

Steps to do:

1. By the hardware components needed (see ko-fi page)
2. Download Etcher to flash the SD card
    https://www.balena.io/etcher/
3. Download Raspbian Lite 
    https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest
4. Programm Raspbian Lite to SD card with Etcher
5. Edit the wpa_supplicant.conf and insert your WLAN credentials
6. Copy the ssh file and the wpa_supplicant.conf to boot partition of SD card
7. Create an Thingspeak account
    https://thingspeak.com/
8. Boot up your Pi and connect via Putty / SSH
9. Login with "pi"/"raspberry"
10 Download the heater.py from this repo
```
    cd ~
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f3yb4la/DCLV-Monitoring/master/heater.py
```
11. Change the ip adress as well as the thingspeak keys in the heater.py file. You find it under your Thingsspeak channel - Settings
```
    nano heater.py
```
12. Save your settings with CTRL+X -- Y(es)
    
13. Optional - change the data entries which are transfered to Thingspeak to your needs
14. Install all needed packages
``` 
    sudo apt-get update
    
    sudo apt-get install python3

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

    sudo python3 -m pip install thingspeak
```
15. Test the python script with
---
    python3 heater.py
---
16. Modifying the crontab for calling heater.py every 10 min // selecting (1) for nano as editor
```   
   crontab -e
